# Simple-Static-Site-Generator-Python
drag n' drop static site generator

1. Create a template (A full html website)
2. Put variables instead of content
3. Create simplistic html files as content (almost text files)
4. Add specific comments to specify custom variables
5. drag n' drop your files onto the bat or multiple.py

The exact fashion of these specific comments are <!-- |ELEMENT|*Name here*|BLOCK -->
Output is generated in the parent folder by default.

Do not use space in file names, for some reason it caused brutal destruction to me. (Folders can have spaces though)
